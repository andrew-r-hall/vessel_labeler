This is the beginnings of a neural network for labelling blood vessels in T1-weighted MRI's of the head. This will hopefully be helpful in attempting to look at glymphatic function / brain inflammation with structural scans.

These data were taken from the public repository 'Designed Database of MR Brain Images of Healthy Volunteers' --E. Bullitt , K. Smith , W. Lin at the University of North Carolina. Available at https://data.kitware.com/#collection/591086ee8d777f16d01e0724

The Neural net is an implementation of the Scikit-Learn Multi-Layer Perceptron trained using backpropagation. (MLPClassifier)
